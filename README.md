A **SINoALICE** discord slave for documenting colosseum fights in a Google Sheet

## What does this bot do?
Parses information from discord chat

The Magic | How
:-----------|-------------------------
Upload screenshots from discord chat into a Google spreadsheet | `!upload` 
Write extra text information from discord chat into specific cells of the spreadsheet |`!comment`
Differentiate between servers/channels/users and use their respective spreadsheet for commands | _auto_
lol | `!waifu` 


## How does it do that?
